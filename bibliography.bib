  abstract  = {We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.},

  annote    = {Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan (2002) investigate sentiment classification, aiming to categorize documents by overall opinion rather than topic. Using a large dataset of movie reviews, they compare Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and support vector machines, finding that these algorithms significantly outperform human-selected word lists but still achieve lower accuracy than in topic-based classification. The paper highlights challenges unique to sentiment analysis, including subtle language cues, rhetorical contrasts, and the need for contextual understanding (e.g., negation). Published in the \textit{Proceedings of EMNLP} and widely cited, the work is highly credible and foundational to sentiment analysis research. While the paper's models may seem simple by today's standards, they illustrate enduring concepts such as feature representation (bag-of-words, unigrams vs. bigrams) and classification tradeoffs. As a cornerstone in the field, this source highlights the early challenges of sentiment analysis and sets the stage for evaluating modern neural and transformer-based approaches.}
