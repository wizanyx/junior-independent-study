  abstract   = {Sentiment analysis has come long way since it was introduced as a natural language processing task nearly 20 years ago. Sentiment analysis aims to extract the underlying attitudes and opinions toward an entity. It has become a powerful tool used by governments, businesses, medicine, marketing, and others. The traditional sentiment analysis model focuses mainly on text content. However, technological advances have allowed people to express their opinions and feelings through audio, image and video channels. As a result, sentiment analysis is shifting from unimodality to multimodality. Multimodal sentiment analysis brings new opportunities with the rapid increase of sentiment analysis as complementary data streams enable improved and deeper sentiment detection which goes beyond text-based analysis. Audio and video channels are included in multimodal sentiment analysis in terms of broadness. People have been working on different approaches to improve sentiment analysis system performance by employing complex deep neural architectures. Recently, sentiment analysis has achieved significant success using the transformer-based model. This paper presents a comprehensive study of different sentiment analysis approaches, applications, challenges, and resources then concludes that it holds tremendous potential. The primary motivation of this survey is to highlight changing trends in the unimodality to multimodality for solving sentiment analysis tasks.},

  annote     = {Das and Singh (2023) present a comprehensive survey on the evolution of sentiment analysis from text-based methods to multimodal approaches that integrate audio, visual, and textual information. The article reviews traditional techniques such as lexicon-based and machine learning models, and highlights the role of deep learning and transformer-based architectures in advancing multimodal sentiment detection as well as identifying trends such as the growing reliance on pretrained language models and cross-modal embeddings. It discusses applications in domains like politics, healthcare, finance, and social media, while also emphasizing challenges such as sarcasm detection, inter- and intra-modality dynamics, low-resource languages, and high computational costs. The authors catalog widely used sentiment lexicons, benchmark datasets (e.g., IMDB, SST, CMU-MOSEI), and evaluation metrics, offering guidance for new researchers in the field. Published in ACM Computing Surveys and peer-reviewed, the work is highly credible and valuable for understanding both the state of the art and open research directions in multimodal sentiment analysis.}

  abstract  = {The relentless surge in the volume of data generated across online platforms necessitates sophisticated approaches to glean actionable insights, particularly in discerning the sentiment encased within user-generated comments. This paper presents an intricate exploration of applying deep learning technologies, specifically the Transformer neural network model, in classifying sentiments expressed in a copious corpus of 1.6 million tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset. Endeavoring beyond conventional models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), this research meticulously evaluates the performance enhancements offered by the Transformer architecture in the realm of sentiment analysis. Our methodology entails the comprehensive utilization of the Transformer model, renowned for its prowess in handling sequential data, to unearth the underlying sentiments in the tweets, categorizing them aptly as positive, neutral, or negative. The empirical results emanating from this study delineate a noteworthy improvement in classification accuracy and model robustness, solidifying the Transformer's position as a formidable architecture for sentiment analysis tasks. The enlightening findings of this research offer a pivotal contribution to the continuous efforts in augmenting sentiment analysis methodologies, emphasizing the substantial potentials of integrating advanced deep learning models in processing and analyzing online platform comments. Through this work, we envisage fostering innovative advancements in the field, cultivating enhanced techniques for accurate, efficient, and impactful sentiment analysis in the burgeoning digital landscapes.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.},

Using a large dataset of movie reviews, they compare Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and support vector machines, finding that these algorithms significantly outperform human-selected word lists but still achieve lower accuracy than in topic-based classification. The paper highlights challenges unique to sentiment analysis, including subtle language cues, rhetorical contrasts, and the need for contextual understanding (e.g., negation). Published in the \textit{Proceedings of EMNLP} and widely cited, the work is highly credible and foundational to sentiment analysis research. While the paper's models may seem simple by today's standards, they illustrate enduring concepts such as feature representation (bag-of-words, unigrams vs. bigrams) and classification tradeoffs. As a cornerstone in the field, this source highlights the early challenges of sentiment analysis and sets the stage for evaluating modern neural and transformer-based approaches.}

  annote    = {Mohammad (2021) provides a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis, tracing its evolution from early polarity detection in product reviews to contemporary models that capture valence, discrete emotions, and complex affectual states. The chapter outlines major challenges—including subtle and figurative language, cross-cultural variation, and the difficulty of obtaining annotated data—while also surveying advances in machine learning such as deep neural networks, transfer learning, and contextual embeddings. It reviews resources like emotion lexicons, annotated corpora, and shared evaluation tasks, emphasizing their role in advancing the field. Importantly, Mohammad highlights ethical concerns, noting that sentiment systems can reproduce and amplify human biases, raising fairness issues in applications such as hiring, lending, and public policy. Published in Emotion Measurement 2021, the work is both highly credible and well-grounded in both theory and practice. Its breadth makes it highly relevant to projects exploring sentiment classification, as it not only synthesizes two decades of scholarship but also identifies open research problems, such as modeling figurative language and ensuring fairness in NLP systems.}
